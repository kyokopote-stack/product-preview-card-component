## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (SCSS syntax)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I used **Sass** and created variables for all text and spacing values.  
At first, defining all the variables felt a bit tedious, but once I started coding the main part, it made everything much easier!  
I’ll definitely continue coding this way from now on.

### Continued development

I’d like to keep improving my workflow with Sass — especially by organizing variables, mixins, and partials more efficiently in future projects.
